## Overview of the analysis
Bike sharing has recently become popular in big cities. There is data available online that can be analyzed in order to confirm the viability of launching bike sharing services in metropolitan areas. The current analysis aims to understand the demographics, service usage times, most visited locations and bike checkout duration per customer.

## Results
 - Downtown New York offers plenty of locations for bike pick up and drop off; several locations pop up as frequently visited. Park Ave and West Str. seem to be very popular with customers of the analyzed bike sharing service.
 - 65% of all bike sharing service customers identify as male; there is an opportunity for the organization to offer a service specifically targeted at female users in order to enhance the customer experience and encourage more female customers to use the service.
 - most bikes are used for 30 minutes of less; this means that customers prefer to travel short distances on shared bikes; 
 - subscribers are more likely to frequently use the bike sharing service, especially during the weekdays; the service is used throughout the day during weekends, and on workdays it is very popular during rush hour periods between 7 am and 9 am, and 5 pm and 7 pm;
 - interestingly, Thursdays and Fridays are the days when the service scores most rides;

## Summary
Launching a bike sharing services in a metropolitan area can turn into a profitable business if there is a good number of people interested in using the service for short rides (~30 min or less). Men are more likely to use the service, but there can be opportunitis to make the service more appealing to female customers, too. 

## Further Analysis
From a health and safety perspective, it should be noted that users of bike sharing services tend to enjoy dropping bicycles off at various locations and thus can potentially become a danger for the health and safery of the general population. Additional discovery work is needed in order to identify areas where accidents are likely to occur (due to shart turns, narrow pathways, busy intersections, etc.). It is also important to come up with a system that alerts service managers when bicycles are due for repairs. Further analysis needs to take place in order to figure out best hours for bike maintenance and regular maintenance cycles.
